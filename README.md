# Comparis


What has been done:
 Simple API which has 2 endpoints:
  GET - To get processed payments by Id
  POST - run-payment: Process payments filling AccountFrom, AccountTo and Amount.
  
  How to run:
  In the solution folder using a console, run docker-compose command: 
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
  
  Containers created:
   - comparis.api -> Web API http://localhost:8020/swagger/index.html
   - comparisdb -> SQL Server -> Server=localhost;Database=ComparisDb;User Id=sa;Password=admin1234;
   - jagerservice -> Jaeger tracing tool: http://localhost:16686/
  Obs -> Jaeger is saving tracings only running API from Visual Studio, it is not saving by container to container, it is an issue that I will fix soon.
